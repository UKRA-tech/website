The United Kingdom Rocketry Association (UKRA) is a body of volunteers working to improve Rocketry for all in the UK. UKRA represents the rocketry community at a national level, striving to improve working relationships with the ​CAA​, ​HSE ​and local police forces.

The Safety Code document is updated from time to time and published by the Council of UKRA. The document sets out the minimum expected standards for a safe environment when executing amateur rocket flights.
The Range Safety Officer (RSO) always has the final authority for the interpretation of this code. The latest version of the Safety Code may be found at the [UKRA website](​www.ukra.org.uk)

## Scope

Refer to Appendix D (Definitions) for full definitions of capitalised terms within this document.

This Safety Code may be applied to all rocket launches up to and including O-class (see Appendix A, Rocket Motor Impulse Classes).

For Model Rockets section 7 (High Power Rocketry) and Section 8 (Research) do not apply.

For High Power Rocketry section 7 (High Power Rocketry) applies. Section 8 (Research) should be read to familiarise the reader with the constraints and concepts for Research and Experimental flights.

Any Rocket involving any of the following will automatically be classified as Research/Experimental and Section 8 (Research) applies:

* Thrust is provided by a Liquid Propellant Engine.
* Thrust is provided by a non-commercial Rocket Motor, including non-commercial Hybrid
Motors.
* Total Impulse exceeds 40,960 Ns (O-Class).
* Active stabilisation.
* Any unproven design of Rocket.
* Any unproven design of recovery system.
* Rockets that are constructed of unnecessarily dense or non-deformable materials, for
example metal nose-cones.

## General Rules

stuff

### Law

All fliers must comply with all relevant laws and bye-laws. Specific attention should be paid to:

* CAA/ANO regulations 96 (Rockets) and 240 (Endangering safety of an aircraft)
* Airspace restrictions
* Health and Safety Executive regulations regarding manufacture, acquisition, import, transfer, storage and handling of explosives as they pertain to Rocket Motors.

UKRA maintains guidance on the application of the above on the UKRA website. Further details may be found [here](http://www.ukra.org.uk/)

### Safety

#### Shared Responsibility

Safety is the concern of all present and is the shared responsibility of all. Flights causing damage or injury whilst involved in rocketry should be reported to the Range Safety Officer, the club organiser/chair and/or UKRA.
Minor mishaps may also be reported, anonymously if preferred, to UKRA to guide future developments in policies and the Safety Code.

​####​ Range Safety Officer (RSO)

A Range Safety Officer must be appointed for each launch or launch session. For Model Rockets the RSO should be familiar with the concepts and risks associated with Model Rockets. For other rockets, including High Power Rockets, the RSO must be a club recognised RSO.
The RSO has full responsibility for the Launch Area and has final approval authority for all rocket related activities within the Launch Area.
The RSO is expected to inspect each Rocket prior to launch and deny launch approval if he/she is not confident that the Rocket flight may be made safely and in accordance with this Safety Code. The flier is expected to be able to answer any questions the RSO has regarding the design, assembly or operation of the Rocket.
Fliers and spectators must defer to the RSO for all activity within the Launch Area and must not launch any rocket without the explicit approval of the RSO.

### Insurance

Insurance should be in place for all Rocket flights.

For individuals and clubs the British Model Flying Association (BMFA) provide a comprehensive insurance package covering rocketry activities following this Safety Code. Full details are available on the BMFA website: ​http://www.bmfa.org/

### Disreputable Behaviour

The rocketry community, including UKRA, has worked tirelessly with government organisations
to allow amateur and professional rockets to be launched with minimal government restriction.
Behaviour bringing rocketry into disrepute should be reported to the Range Safety Officer, the club and/or UKRA.

## The Rocket

### Construction

The Rocket must be constructed of components and materials appropriate to the forces expected during flight.

Particular attention should be applied to the choice of materials, choice of construction, joints between components and secure attachment of recovery devices.

The Rocket must be constructed sufficiently to survive all reasonably expected events during flight and fliers are recommended to ground-test components where possible.

Rigidity expectations will vary depending on the exact rocket, however the following guidance should be considered:

* Avoid metal components except where strictly necessary, for example where required for structural integrity or heat dissipation at transonic speeds.
* Avoid sharp edges, particularly nose cones and sharp fin edges.
* Material choice and structural design are critical for all rockets.

### Stability

The Rocket must be designed to be passively stable in all flight phases. Fliers must be able to demonstrate that the Centre of Pressure is a minimum of one body tube diameter behind the Centre of Gravity at all stages of flight.

It is recommended that, where possible, the Centre of Pressure is marked on the Rocket to ease stability verification during the Pre-Flight checks.

Active stabilisation systems may only be flown as Research/Experimental flights and section 8 applies.

### Payload

The following may never be carried as a Rocket payload:

* Live animals
* Intentionally flammable, explosive or harmful substances, for example corrosives,
pyrotechnics and smoke canisters except where necessary for flight or recovery.
* Active guidance systems except those intentionally returning the Rocket to the Launch
Site during recovery.

### Propulsion

Under UK law all solid Propellant Rocket Motors are classified as explosives and therefore must only be manufactured at registered sites meeting strict regulations. UK law permits most Hybrid and Liquid Rocket Motors to be designed, built and flown without being manufactured by registered entities, however the pressure vessels must comply with all relevant legislation. Non-commercially manufactured hybrid rocket motors must be flown as Research/Experimental under Section 8 (Research).

Motor classes and requirements are listed in Appendix A.

Considerations:

* No flier may attempt to launch a Rocket using a non-commercial solid Propellant Rocket
Motor.
* All solid Propellant Rocket Motors must have been commercially manufactured and meet current legislation, including labelling constraints.
* Commercially manufactured Hybrid Rocket Motors may be used but require a UKRA RSO certified to Level 2 or higher to approve the flight.
* Non-commercial Hybrid Rocket Motors or Liquid Motors are considered Research/Experimental flights and section 8 applies.
* The average thrust of the Rocket Motor(s) must, at all stages in flight, exceed three
times the weight of the propelled vehicle. UKRA recommends that the average thrust is between 5 and 10 times the weight of the propelled vehicle.

### Recovery

Rockets must be designed to return all parts safely to the ground so that they may be flown again. Rockets must be designed and built so that the recovery systems are protected from the forces and thermal loads associated with flight.

Electronic or mechanical ejection or air-start systems must be constructed in such a manner as to permit arming and disarming of those systems without affecting the orientation or position of the Rocket.

Particular attention should be paid to:

* Including thermal insulation (e.g. wadding, flameproof materials or pistons) between an explosive ejection system and the recovery devices.
* Ground testing untested ejection systems to confirm adequate and safe performance for in-flight use.
* Assembly, installation and testing of electronic ejection systems.
* Choosing recovery devices appropriate to the expected landing location, for example floatation devices for water landings and high visibility parachutes/streamers for crop landings.
* Specific requirements for Night Flying, noted in section 6.2.2 (Visibility) below.

## Launch Site

### Site Suitability

Launch Sites should be a suitable open area for launching and recovering Rockets. It must conform to the minimum dimensions laid out in Appendix B. Permission must have been granted by the land-owner or occupier.

Launch Sites must:

* Be more than 5km from the nearest commercial airport or airfield.
* Be more than 1km from any area where distress flares may be used (for example large lakes, mountains or coastal areas) unless prior permission has been granted by the relevant authorities, for example the coast guard or mountain rescue organisation.

### Site Layout

Launch Sites must:

* Offer a method of managing public access to the Launch Area, for example, it must be possible to manage public footpaths in the Launch Area so that launch activities are prevented while footpath traffic is present.
* Offer a method whereby the RSO can advise all personnel on-site of launches, heads-up flights and relevant events.
* Provide visibility for RSOs to validate clear skies prior to flight.
* Offer clear lines of sight between the launch area and the expected recovery areas.
* Offer a clear recovery area both downwind and upwind of the launch area.

### Launch Rails

All Rockets must launch from a launchpad or launch rail which meets the following requirements:

* The Rocket is guided along the entire length of the guide rod or guide rail using an appropriate mounting system (e.g. launch lug or rail button).
* The guide rod or guide rail is long enough for the Rocket to achieve a stable flight speed before any guide device (launch lug or rail button) clears the rail.
* The guide rod or guide rail is rigid enough that the Rocket proceeds up its length without significant flex in the guide at any expected wind speed.
* Steps are taken to protect fliers and spectators from injury, particularly the top of launch rods being able to enter their eyes. Launch rod caps should be considered if the top of the launch rod is below eye level.
* Steps are taken to protect the ground and any supporting launch equipment from the hot gases expelled by the Rocket Motor. A blast deflector should be considered.
* The launch rod or launch rail is within 20 degrees of vertical except in the case of Rocket vehicles obtaining lift through wing surfaces, e.g. boosted gliders.
* Clear of flammable materials, for example dry grass, dry crop, to a radius of three metres.

### Launch Controller

The launch controller must ignite the motors electrically in a manner permitting ignition to occur outside the safe distances in Appendix C.

The launch controller must feature:

* A safety key/firing key which, when removed, prevents ignition.
* A momentary (return to off) launch button which, when released, isolates the ignition circuit.
* Protection against ignition due to misuse, for example:
  * Inadvertent connection of igniter circuits to battery circuits.
  * Connection of igniters to controller while the ignition circuit is live.
* Protection against ignition due to interference, for example:
  * Insulated wires preventing accidental short.
  * Cryptographic or secure authentication for wireless triggers.

### Preparing the site

Launch sessions must only occur with the permission of both the land occupier and any flying clubs normally launching at the Launch Site.
A NOTAM (Notice to Airmen) must be issued if flying may pose a hazard to other airspace users, typically if flights exceed an expected altitude of 120 metres (400 feet) above ground level. NOTAMs should be submitted to the CAA a minimum of 28 days in advance of the launch session. A template NOTAM may be found on the UKRA website.
The launch area, launch rod, launch rails and launch controllers must be prepared according to the requirements in section 5.

### Managing Personnel

The launch organiser and RSO should work together to ensure that all attending personnel can be adequately managed throughout the session. Attention should be paid to:

* Ensuring that the launch area only contains required personnel before, during and immediately after launch. Safe distances in Appendix C must be adhered to.
* Ensuring that spectators do not tamper with, modify, handle or recover rockets without the explicit approval of the flier.
* Ensuring that children are adequately managed by responsible personnel. Special arrangements may need to be made depending on the individual or group requirements.
* Teams associated with group launches, ensuring that the launch area and the launch can be managed safely. Only the minimum necessary number of personnel should be permitted near the rocket for final preparation.

### Emergency Management

#### Fire Prevention

Rocket Motors inherently pose a fire risk. Launch organisers should plan for both fire prevention (e.g. removing flammable materials from the launch area, wetting dry vegetation) and fire extinguishing facilities (fire buckets, fire extinguishers).

#### First Aid

First aid kit and personnel familiar with its use must be available and immediately accessible from the Launch Area. Attention should be paid to ensuring that the first aid kit contents are suitable for:

* Injuries associated with the rocket and launch equipment, for example cuts.
* Injuries associated with the site, for example slips and falls.
* Injuries associated with propellants, for example burns, corrosion and eye cleaning.

#### Emergency Escalation process

Plans should be made to ensure any emergency callout can be made with all relevant information readily available, for example:

* Exact site location and directions.
* Site access requirements.
* Details of affected parties and any specific requirements (e.g. allergies, medical conditions).
* Site contact numbers.

## Flying

### Launch Area

The RSO is responsible for the Launch Area and has authority over all activities within it. The RSO must explicitly approve all flights and may withhold flight approval at any point should he/she not have confidence that the flight may be undertaken safely and with predictable outcomes.

### Flying Conditions

#### Airspace

The flier must ensure that the flight does not enter controlled airspace except as permitted by the current Civil Aviation Authority Air Navigation Order. Fliers must review aviation charts, controlled airspace locations and NOTAMs from other airspace users prior to each flying session. Flying clubs and RSOs should consider having these documents readily available for inspection by fliers, members, visitors or officials representing government organisations

#### Visibility

Cloud cover must be clear to sufficient altitude so that:

* The Rocket may be recovered safely.
* The Rocket may be launched without posing any risk to aircraft. Rockets launched deliberately into or above the cloud layer must be flown with the safety of other airspace users assured, for example:
  * Radar coverage
  * Air traffic control clearance

Night Flights must not occur unless:

* The Rocket is suitably illuminated over the entire course of the flight including launch, ascent and recovery.
* The flight occurs in an area where the flight cannot be mistaken for a distress flare.

#### Wind speeds

At wind speeds exceeding 10mph the flier should choose the Rocket Motor carefully to ensure that stable flight is achieved before the Rocket leaves the Launch Rail, particularly paying attention to the possibility of weather-cocking, where the Rocket rotates into the wind due to the wind applying a rotational force through the fins.

Rockets must not be flown in winds exceeding 20mph. UKRA recommends that rockets are not flown in winds exceeding 15mph.

The flier and RSO should each verify the wind speed at the expected flight altitude permits a safe and predictable flight, dispersal and recovery.

### Pre-flight

#### Rocket

The Rocket must be inspected for condition, integrity and degradation due to storage, transport or age. Attention should be given to all aspects of construction.

Prior to installation on the launch rail the Centre of Gravity of the Rocket should be confirmed to be a minimum of one calibre (body tube diameter) forward of the Centre of Pressure.

​6.3.2.​ Igniters

Igniters for solid propellant Rocket Motors must be installed in the Rocket Motor:

* At a location designated specifically for installation of igniters in motors, usually the launch pad, immediately prior to launch.
* With the Rocket Motor exhaust facing away from personnel and volatile/flammable items/equipment.

Igniters for pyrotechnic ejection or pyrotechnic ignition systems must be installed in the Rocket with all electronic systems unpowered. Electronic ignition circuits must not be powered until the Rocket is either:

* On the launch pad, immediately prior to launch.
* In a test area specifically designated for the purposes of testing pyrotechnic charges.

Ignition of any igniters must not occur except as designated above. In case of abandonment or failure of the launch/test the igniters must be removed from the motors prior to the removal of the Rocket from the designated area

### Launching

When ready to launch the following process must be observed. Each step is described in further detail in the following sections:

1. Entering the Launch Area
1. Installation of Rocket on Launch Rail
1. Retirement to safe distance
1. Approval for Launch
1. Countdown 6. Launch

#### Entering the Launch Area

Approval must be obtained from the RSO prior to entering the Launch Area. The RSO is expected to validate the pre-flight checks and deny approval if he/she is not confident that the flight may be undertaken safely and with predictable outcomes.

Children must be accompanied by a responsible adult. The RSO must not be the responsible adult while also on RSO duty.

#### Installation of Rocket on Launch Rail

Installation of the Rocket on the Launch Rail may occur immediately before or immediately after installation of the igniters in the motor in accordance with the pre-flight conditions. The Rocket must slide easily along the length of the Launch Rail.

The Launch Rail must not be adjusted to an angle beyond 20 degrees from vertical unless the Rocket obtains lift from wing surfaces, for example a boosted glider.

#### Retirement to safe distance

All persons not required for the launch must leave the Launch Area prior to the launch. Persons required for the launch should retire to the launch controller or to an area directed by the RSO.

#### Approval for Launch

The RSO has final approval for the launch and must make final weather conditions, airspace and safety checks prior to permitting the launch.

The RSO should decline approval for the launch if they feel that the flier has not taken all reasonable steps to ensure that the rocket lands and may be recovered within the launch site.

#### Countdown

A clear countdown, audible to all relevant persons, must be made prior to launch. This countdown should start from a count of at least five and be counted at a cadence sufficiently slow for observers to advise the RSO of any areas of concern prior to actual launch.

#### Launch

The relevant launch controller buttons should be applied promptly after completion of the countdown and released immediately after ignition or after a count of three seconds, whichever occurs sooner. The safety key should be removed as soon as practical after launch.

In case of misfire, failure to ignite, catastrophic motor combustion or other unexpected outcome the safety key must be immediately removed from the launch controller. In case of fire or other event requiring immediate attention, no-one may approach the Rocket except the minimum necessary to resolve the incident. In other circumstances no-one may approach the Rocket before a fixed time has elapsed according to the following conditions:

* In case of catastrophic motor combustion or a Low Power Rocket, a minimum of one minute.
* In all other cases three minutes.

The RSO may, at their discretion, discern that alternative actions may be taken if safety may be affected by waiting for the times above, for example in the case of fire.

In the case of abandonment or failure of the launch for any reason, including those above, only the flier or a flier-nominated representative may approach the Rocket until all onboard electronics are disarmed. The electronics must be disarmed without affecting the orientation or position of the Rocket to avoid accidental triggering of charges or air-start events.

### Recovery

Recovery of the Rocket must not be attempted until the descent is fully complete.
No attempt may be made to recover Rockets landing in dangerous places or places where permission has not been sought to recover the Rocket. Attention must be given to power lines and no flier or recovery team may approach a power line to recover a Rocket entangled in the power line or supporting infrastructure.
Attention should be paid to footfall and vehicle use during recovery. Care should be taken to minimise crop damage, ground erosion and worrying livestock.
Care should be taken to only recover Rockets or their parts if their design and implementation is familiar and well understood. Recovery team members must not attempt to collect Rockets or their parts if unfamiliar with their construction. Instead the Rocket should be left untouched and the location should be identified to the flier or their recovery team.

### Post-flight

Flight events should be noted and understood for future learning. Any unexpected behaviours
during flight or recovery should be investigated and discussed to determine the cause.
In the case of adverse behaviour the flier should consider discussing the flight with the RSO, club representatives or UKRA to further understand how to avoid similar incidents.

The RSO should report any unsafe, unexpected, dangerous or undesirable outcomes to the club and/or UKRA as appropriate. Unsafe outcomes should be reported to UKRA at the first available opportunity to direct future improvements to this Safety Code.

## High Power Rocketry (HPR)

### Requirements

Fliers flying Rockets with a Total Impulse greater than 160 Ns (G-class) must:

* If an individual flier: Follow the UKRA certification process, detailed on the UKRA website: http://www.ukra.org.uk/
* If a team of fliers (e.g. University team): Follow the UKRA Team Project Support process, detailed on the UKRA website: ​http://www.ukra.org.uk/
* Either:
  * Have already achieved the certification listed in Appendix A (Rocket Motor Impulse Classes) OR
  * Be in the process of attempting the certification listed in Appendix A (Rocket Motor Impulse Classes) as per the certification requirements listed on the UKRA website: http://www.ukra.org.uk/

Fliers flying Rockets with a Total Impulse greater than 10,240 Ns (M-class) using BMFA insurance must follow the UKRA Large Rocket Scheme, detailed on the UKRA website: http://www.ukra.org.uk/
Fliers should note that CAA permission is always required to fly Rockets with a Total Impulse exceeding 10,240 Ns. Details may be found in the CAA ANO regulation 96 (correct at the time of writing) and related documents. UKRA recommends that fliers follow the UKRA Large Rocket Scheme noted above to benefit from the shared knowledge from previous flights, minimise the chance of errors and maximise the chance of the flight being approved.
The RSO for an HPR flight must be certified to a level equal or greater to the flight being attempted and have appropriate proof of this certification, usually the UKRA membership card showing their certification level.

### Documentation

The following documentation must be made available by the flier for inspection by the RSO, site officials or government officials (e.g. the police, CAA):

* Proof of certification level, typically the UKRA membership card, unless attempting level 1 HPR certification.
* Proof of insurance, typically the BMFA membership card.
* Any required motor documentation (e.g. Explosives Certificate, RCA or Registered Store certificate).

### Rocket Construction

HPR fliers are expected to have a good understanding of Rocket construction and to have applied a high construction standard throughout the Rocket build and preparation.
HPR fliers are expected to be able to answer any questions posed to them by the RSO, including details of construction methods, adhesive use, recovery methods, failure modes, stability calculations, expected flight events and likely dispersal during descent and recovery.. The RSO is expected to refuse flight permission if he/she suspects that the flier does not understand the above principles or the Rocket may not be flown safely.

## Research Requirements

Rockets matching any of the specified conditions in Section 2 (Applicability) will be considered Research/Experimental flights and this section applies in full. The RSO is expected to refuse flight approval if this process has not been followed.
The flier or team lead must notify the UKRA Safety and Technical committee a minimum of thirty days before the intended flight. Approval must be received from UKRA Safety and Technical before the flight is attempted and this approval must be provided to the RSO in advance of the launch.
To permit approval by UKRA S&T the flier should include:
● Details of the Rocket construction, including the design, construction method, build
considerations and recovery strategies.
● Details of the expected flight profile.
● Details of relevant testing and previous flights.
● Details of expected failure modes and safety considerations.
Hybrid Motors and Liquid Engines
Special consideration must be given to the increased risks associated with Rockets containing pressure vessels. UK law applies strict regulations and guidance to pressure vessels and non-commercially manufactured systems must be able to demonstrate compliance with these regulations.
All Research Rocket Motors must have a demonstrable ground testing record to include performance data, expected flight characteristics and expected performance variation.
Additional considerations include:
● Providing a method whereby flight tanks may be pressurised remotely, without a flier
entering the Safe Distance.
● Providing a method whereby flight tanks may be depressurised remotely, without a flier
entering the Safe Distance.
● Ensuring that pressurised gases are handled correctly, temperature considerations are
observed and depressurisation risks (including burns and frostbite) are considered.
● Ensuring that the Rocket and the Rocket Motor are designed and constructed to
accommodate the physical characteristics of launch, flight and recovery, including forces, acceleration, vibration, sound barrier pressure waves and temperature variations.
19

 ● Providing a safe and proven ignition method.

  ​9.​ Appendix A: Rocket Motor Impulse Classes
The ​Total Impulse ​of a ​Rocket ​or ​Rocket Motor ​is typically measured in Newton seconds and
is calculated as the product of the average thrust (in Newtons) and the duration (in seconds).
Total Impulse ​may be used in the context of an individual ​Rocket Motor​ or in the context of a whole rocket. In the latter case the ​Total Impulse​ of a ​Rocket​ is the sum of the ​Total Impulse of each individual ​Rocket Motor​.

  ​10.​ Appendix B: Launch Site Dimensions
It is important that the launch site is sized appropriately for the motor impulse being used.
The table below lists the minimum site dimensions for each motor impulse class. The distances stated are the diameter of a circle centred at the location of the launch pad. The rocket flight should be planned such that all reasonable steps are taken to ensure that the rocket lands and may be recovered in this area.
For flights with increased safety considerations, the next largest distance must be used after the row associated with the Total Impulse. Examples of such flights where these considerations come into play are:
● The flight involves a boosted glider or winged recovery.
● The flight is considered Research or Experimental.
The site minimum dimension should be the maximum of:
● The distance from the table below, noting the previous statement regarding special
flights.
● Half the maximum expected flight altitude of any Rocket to be flown.
Examples:
● An M impulse-class rocket flying to 2,500 feet would require a minimum site dimension
of 1492 feet (the greater of the dimension from the table below and half the expected
flight altitude).
● A J impulse-class rocket flying to 12,000 feet would require a minimum site dimension of
6,000 feet (2,000 yards, approximately 1.4 miles) being half the expected flight altitude
and greater than the distance from the table below.
● An experimental helicopter recovery rocket propelled by motors equivalent to G
impulse-class flying to 1,500 feet would require a minimum site dimension of 1,476 feet. As an experimental flight the distance from the ‘H’ impulse-class is taken from the table below.

The next largest distance in the table must be used where any of the following conditions are met:
● The flight involves a boosted glider or winged recovery.
● The flight is considered Research or Experimental.
At the RSO’s discretion the minimum safe distance may be reduced for those required to facilitate the launch of the rocket providing that:
● Safety of the flier, spectators and the public can be assured.
● The distance between the launch rail and anyone not directly involved in the launch is
greater than or equal to the distances in the table below. Safe distance table
