UKRA Level 3 Certification is required by any UKRA member wishing to fly a rocket powered by rocket motors of total impulse of M-class through to O-class, under UKRA insurance.

Level 3 certification requires the candidate to have passed their L2 Certification and a successful test flight performed before a UKRA certified safety officer. Refer to your members' handbook for detailed requirements.

Level 3 certification also requires the candidate to submit a detailed, written report on the rocket they intend to launch for their level 3 certification. It is strongly recommended that this report is submitted to the UKRA Safety & Technical Comittee before construction of the proposed certification vehicle is begun if you do not do this you may not be allowed to launch.

The supporting documentation for the Level 3 certification is available for download as .pdf or Portable Document Format files. To read this you will need a copy of Acrobat Reader. A free version of this is a available from Adobe, by clicking on the button below.
