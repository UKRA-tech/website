## Certification completion

The certification rocket must be owned and built by the person performing the flight (the rocket may be scratch built or a kit).

It is important that a correctly filled out form is submitted to UKRA after a certification attempt. This is the responsibility of the flyer.

No certificate or upgraded membership card can be issued until payment and form are received. 

The Certification Paperwork can be downloaded here, only this form will now be acceptable. Refer to your Members' information pack for detailed certification requirements. Certification recognition Members of other recognised Rocketry Organisations joining UKRA can do so at a certification level corresponding to their certification level within that organisation. This applies to both permanent and temporary UKRA membership. Proof of current membership and certification level of the recognised rocketry organisation will be required. These organisations also recognise our Senior Level 1 to 3 certifications. UKRA currently recognises the Senior HPR certifications awarded by the following organisations:

* Interessengemeinschaft Modellraketen e.V. (IMR)
* National Association of Rocketry (NAR)
* Tripoli Rocketry Association (TRA)
* Canadian Association of Rocketry (CAR)
