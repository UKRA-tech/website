UKRA Range Safety Officer Certification covers any UKRA member wishing to become a UKRA certified Range Safety Officer. A UKRA Range Safety Officer may act as Range Safety Officer at any launch or launch event for which the total impulse of any rocket flown, is not greater than the level of certification that the Range Safety Officer is certified to. i.e. a UKRA Range Safety Officer who is only certified to Level 1, may not act as a Range Safety Officer at a launch or launch event at which rockets which fall into the Level 2 category are flown. In order to obtain UKRA Range Safety Officer certification, the candidate is required to successfully pass a written, multiple choice UKRA level 2 examination. Once the exam has been passed, they must undergo an interview. A Study Guide for the L2/RSO exam is available for download as a .pdf or Portable Document Format file.
