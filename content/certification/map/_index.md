Hello and welcome to the UKRA Model rocket Achievement Program, generally known as MAP. The United Kingdom Rocketry Association, UKRA set up the MAP award scheme up to help people who are looking to make a start in the hobby. MAP is designed to give a new model rocket flyers a simple introduction with a little structure and a goal or two. Though suited for younger flyers we encourage anyone beginning on their rocket flying journey to get involved. The MAP system works by creating model rocket activities (we call them tasks) and joining them together in this MAP project. We have divided MAP into Bronze, Silver and Gold activities (see section below,) to separate MAP model flying from High power we refer to the various steps as awards not certifications. The Bronze level is a simple starting point, consisting of just three tasks and getting a little more complex with the Silver award. The Gold award is a project, and we hope Gold constitutes a good chunk of work on something you'll have designed yourself.
